New models to Colobot: Gold Edition http://colobot.info
They are based on models from the repository https://github.com/colobot/colobot-data/tree/dev-models. They are devoid of LOD layers. Original files are still in separate directory.
Installation: Just copy the files from the folder "mod" to the folder "models" in the game directory "data". You can also made new directory in "mods" directory (if it doesn't exist - create it), name it as you wish. Inside your mod directory create "models" directory and copy there models you want to see in game. If you change your mind - simply delete/rename directory or files (renaming won't work with directory inside "mods").
Some models include at the end of the suffixes "_alt". These models are used to gather opinions which version is the better.  If someone wants to see how the version "_alt" looks, must remove the suffix. For example, model "lem1f_alt.mod" should be renamed to "lem1f.mod".
No need to copy the other folders to the folder "data". Those files are not recognized by the game.
Folder "alludo" contains a test level with all the models.
