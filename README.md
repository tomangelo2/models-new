New models for Colobot: Gold Edition
-----------
http://colobot.info ; https://github.com/colobot

They are based on models from the repository https://github.com/colobot/colobot-data/tree/dev-models. They are devoid of LOD layers. Original files are still in separate directory.

Installation
-----------
To see how new models look like in the game just copy the files placed in "mod" directory to the "Colobot/Gold/Installation/Directory/data/models" and overwrite all files.

If you don't want to overwrite any original Colobot: Gold Edition models you can also test them as a mod. Just make new directory in "UserProfileHomeDir*/colobot/mods" directory (if it doesn't exist - create it) and name it as you wish, for example "HD-Models-Test-Mod". Inside your mod directory create "models" directory and copy there models you want to see in game. If you change your mind - simply delete/rename directory or files (renaming won't work with directory inside "mods").

No need to copy the other folders to the folder "data". Those files are not recognized by the game.

* Depend of your Operating System:
Windows
Just type to your file explorer:
```
%UserProfile%\colobot
```

Linux
Just type to your file explorer:
```
$HOME
```

Alternative models
-----------
Some models include at the end of the suffixes "_alt". These models are used to gather opinions which version is the better. If someone wants to see how the version "_alt" looks, must remove the suffix. For example, model "lem1f_alt.mod" should be renamed to "lem1f.mod".

Test all models in one level
-----------
Folder "alludo" contains a test level with all the models.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Currently alludo version is compatible only with Colobot 1.7+ original game. See the https://github.com/MrSimbax/colobot-alludo repository for the most up-to-date alludo version for Colobot: Gold Edition.
