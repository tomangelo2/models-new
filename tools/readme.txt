Instructions:

Since Colobot-Model-Converter fully support all file types (.obj, .txt, .mod), there is no need to use binaries in Linux/Windows directories, they are left only just in case. If you still want to convert them with old tools you should look into readme_old.txt

Full instruction how to use Colobot-Model Converter is in Colobot-Model-Converter/README.md
