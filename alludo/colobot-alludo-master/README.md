# Alludo #

Basic Colobot (https://github.com/colobot/colobot) user level for level designers.

Note: current Colobot Gold doesn't support user levels.

# Description #

A basic map for level designers. You can use it as a base to create your own level and share it, if you mention you used Alludo and add me to the credits.

Also, it is a perfect map for testing because of its simplicity and it's easy to modify.

# Features #

* By default the whole map is flat and there is no water.
* Resources are shown by the color lights. They are in the corners.
* 1 grid == 1 square colometer
* `Me` and first bots are immortal.
* All buildings and bots are available.
* There is no living alien.
* There are all objects from the game in the south-east corner of the map.
